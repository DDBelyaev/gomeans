This is my interpretation of KMeans algorithm in Go. It is not intended to be a
production-grade implementation, but rather an attempt to study Golang.
Although, I should say, that it works correctly, and even implements concurrent
cluster calculation, which makes the code utilize machine resources in efficient
manner.
